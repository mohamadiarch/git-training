## git states


files have three state: 1. committed 2. staged 3. modified and untracked

if you create a file but did not add it to stage ===> untracked
if you add a file into staged and edited it after that ===> modified


## vscode
1. you can use "cls" for clear terminal in vscode
2. in File Explorer (hover it) : 

    M means: Modified 
    U means: Untracked
    A: means Index Added ==> after U
    Nothing means: after commit


3. in Editor panel of vscode (user interface) (click it):
   
    Green means ===> new created (Untracked into file)
    Blue means ===> edit committed file (Modified into file)
